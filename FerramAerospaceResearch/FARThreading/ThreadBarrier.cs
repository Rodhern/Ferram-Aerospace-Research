   Serious thanks:		a.g., for tons of bugfixes and code-refactorings
				stupid_chris, for the RealChuteLite implementation
            			Taverius, for correcting a ton of incorrect values
				Tetryds, for finding lots of bugs and issues and not letting me get away with them, and work on example crafts
            			sarbian, for refactoring code for working with MechJeb, and the Module Manager updates
            			ialdabaoth (who is awesome), who originally created Module Manager
                        	Regex, for adding RPM support
				DaMichel, for some ferramGraph updates and some control surface-related features
            			Duxwing, for copy editing the readme
